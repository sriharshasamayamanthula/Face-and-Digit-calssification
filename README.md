# Face-and-Digit-calssification
In the digit classification part, we will be given test data and find whether given image is 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9.
In the face classification part, we will be given test data and find whether given image is Face or not.
I have implemented Naive Bayes Algorithm, Perceptron Algorithm from scratch and used KNN using existing libraries
